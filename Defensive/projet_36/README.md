# Project 36 : Patch Manager

## Objective

Create an MCP server to track security patches and manage deployment plans.

## Concepts to Learn

### Patch Management

Security patches require:
- **Vulnerability Tracking** : Link patches to CVEs
- **Deployment Planning** : Schedule patch deployment
- **Testing** : Verify patches before deployment
- **Rollback** : Plan for patch failures

### MCP Architecture

- **Tools** : Manage patches and deployments
- **Resources** : Expose patch information
- **Prompts** : Generate deployment plans
- **Elicitation** : Confirm deployments

## Use Cases

- Track available security patches
- Plan patch deployments
- Monitor patch status
- Generate deployment reports
