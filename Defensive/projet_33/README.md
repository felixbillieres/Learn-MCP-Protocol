# Project 33 : SIEM MCP (Security Information and Event Management)

## Objective

Create an MCP server to collect, analyze, and alert on security events in real-time.

## Concepts to Learn

### SIEM Systems

A SIEM collects and analyzes security events:
- **Event Collection** : Gather logs from multiple sources
- **Correlation** : Link related events
- **Alerting** : Notify on suspicious activity
- **Rules** : Detection patterns

### MCP Architecture

- **Tools** : Collect and analyze events
- **Resources** : Expose events in real-time
- **Subscriptions** : Alert notifications
- **Prompts** : Generate detection rules
- **Sampling** : Suggest detection patterns

## Use Cases

- Monitor security events across infrastructure
- Detect anomalies and attacks
- Generate detection rules
- Real-time alerting
