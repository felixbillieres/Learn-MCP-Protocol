# Python Exercises for Defensive Project 33

Before creating SIEM MCP servers, let's practice security event processing and correlation.

## Exercise 33: SIEM Event Processing & Alerting

This exercise covers:
- Security event collection and normalization
- Real-time alert generation and correlation
- Threat pattern analysis and detection
- Incident response and reporting
- Event storage and querying

### Key Concepts Covered

- **EventProcessor**: Event validation, normalization, and enrichment
- **AlertEngine**: Rule-based detection and alert generation
- **SIEMDatabase**: Event storage and querying capabilities
- **Threat analysis**: Pattern recognition and risk assessment

### Instructions

1. Open `exercise_33.py`
2. Complete all the TODO comments
3. Run the test: `python3 test_exercise_33.py`

### What you'll practice

- **Event processing**: Parsing and normalizing security events
- **Rule engines**: Pattern matching and alert generation
- **Data correlation**: Finding related events and threats
- **Database operations**: Storing and querying security data
- **Report generation**: Creating incident reports and analysis

### Key Classes

- `SecurityEvent`: Structured security event data
- `Alert`: Alert information with correlated events
- `EventProcessor`: Event validation and enrichment
- `AlertEngine`: Rule evaluation and alert generation
- `SIEMDatabase`: Event storage and querying

### Expected Output

When all tests pass, you should see:
```
🎉 All tests passed! You're ready for Defensive Project 33!
```

### Advanced Features

- **Event correlation**: Linking related security events
- **Risk scoring**: Automatic threat level assessment
- **Pattern analysis**: Detecting attack patterns
- **Incident reporting**: Comprehensive security incident documentation

Once you've completed this exercise, you'll understand the event processing concepts needed for the MCP SIEM system!
