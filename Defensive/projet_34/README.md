# Project 34 : Incident Manager

## Objective

Create an MCP server to manage security incidents with triage workflows and response actions.

## Concepts to Learn

### Incident Response

Security incidents require:
- **Triage** : Assess and prioritize incidents
- **IOCs** : Indicators of Compromise
- **Response Actions** : Steps to contain and remediate
- **Documentation** : Track all actions

### MCP Architecture

- **Tools** : CRUD for incidents
- **Resources** : Expose active incidents
- **Prompts** : Guide triage workflow
- **Elicitation** : Collect incident details
- **Sampling** : Suggest response actions

## Use Cases

- Track security incidents
- Triage and prioritize
- Document response actions
- Generate incident reports
