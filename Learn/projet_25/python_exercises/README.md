# Python Exercises for MCP Project 25

Before building your final complete MCP server, let's practice integrating all MCP features together.

## Exercise 25: Complete MCP Server Integration

This exercise covers:
- Full MCP feature integration
- Server architecture and design patterns
- Feature coordination and data flow
- Production-ready implementation patterns

### Instructions

1. Open `exercise_25.py`
2. Study the complete server implementation
3. Run the test: `python3 test_exercise_25.py`
4. Understand how all features work together

### What you'll practice

- **Feature integration**: Combining tools, resources, prompts
- **Server architecture**: Organizing complex MCP servers
- **Data flow management**: Coordinating between components
- **Production patterns**: Real-world implementation approaches

### Key Concepts

- **MCP ecosystem**: All features working together
- **Server design**: Scalable and maintainable architecture
- **Feature coordination**: Managing complex interactions
- **Production readiness**: Error handling, logging, monitoring

### Expected Output

When all tests pass, you should see:
```
All tests passed! You're ready for MCP Project 25!
```

### Tips

- Plan your server architecture before implementation
- Test feature interactions thoroughly
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Consider scalability and maintenance

Once you've completed this exercise, you'll know how to build complete, production-ready MCP servers with all features integrated!
