# Python Exercises for MCP Project 22

Before implementing advanced security features in MCP, let's practice security validation and threat detection.

## Exercise 22: Advanced Security & Threat Detection

This exercise covers:
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting and abuse detection
- Security event logging and monitoring
- Threat pattern recognition

### Instructions

1. Open `exercise_22.py`
2. Complete all the TODO comments
3. Run the test: `python3 test_exercise_22.py`

### What you'll practice

- **Input validation**: Checking and sanitizing user inputs
- **Rate limiting**: Preventing abuse through request limits
- **Security monitoring**: Logging and analyzing security events
- **Threat detection**: Identifying suspicious patterns

### Key Concepts

- **Input sanitization**: Cleaning potentially dangerous data
- **Rate limiting**: Controlling request frequency
- **Security logging**: Recording security-relevant events
- **Pattern detection**: Identifying malicious behavior

### Expected Output

When all tests pass, you should see:
```
All tests passed! You're ready for MCP Project 22!
```

### Tips

- Validate all inputs, never trust user data
- Implement appropriate rate limits for your use case
- Log security events for monitoring and analysis
- Test with various attack patterns

Once you've completed this exercise, you'll know how to implement advanced security features in MCP!
