# Python Exercises for MCP Project 08

Before implementing MCP resources, let's practice creating and managing resource collections.

## Exercise 08: MCP Resources & Configuration

This exercise covers:
- Resource data structures and management
- Configuration resource patterns
- Resource listing and access methods
- Data organization for resources

### Instructions

1. Open `exercise_08.py`
2. Complete all the TODO comments
3. Run the test: `python3 test_exercise_08.py`

### What you'll practice

- **ResourceManager class**: Organizing resource collections
- **Configuration resources**: Storing and retrieving config data
- **Resource listing**: Creating resource inventories
- **Resource access**: Retrieving specific resources by URI

### Key Concepts

- **Resource URIs**: Unique identifiers for resources
- **Resource metadata**: Type, description, content information
- **Configuration patterns**: Common resource access patterns
- **Data organization**: Structuring resource collections

### Expected Output

When all tests pass, you should see:
```
All tests passed! You're ready for MCP Project 08!
```

### Tips

- Use consistent URI patterns for resources
- Include metadata for each resource
- Organize resources in logical collections
- Handle missing resources gracefully

Once you've completed this exercise, you'll know how to create and manage MCP resource collections!
