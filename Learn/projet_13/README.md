# Project 13: Advanced prompts

## Objective

Create advanced prompts with multiple messages, integrated resources, and complex workflows.

## Concepts to learn

### Multiple messages

A prompt can return multiple messages, allowing you to create conversations or few-shot examples.

### Integrated resources

Prompts can reference server resources directly in messages, allowing you to include dynamic content.

### Complex workflows

By combining multiple messages, resources, and arguments, you can create sophisticated workflows to guide the user or AI.

## What you will create

In this project, you will create advanced prompts with multiple messages and resource references.
