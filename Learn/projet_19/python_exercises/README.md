# Python Exercises for MCP Project 19

Before implementing agentic workflows in MCP, let's practice tool orchestration and decision-making logic.

## Exercise 19: Agentic Workflows & Tool Orchestration

This exercise covers:
- Workflow planning and execution
- Tool selection based on context
- Sequential and conditional operations
- Result aggregation and processing

### Instructions

1. Open `exercise_19.py`
2. Complete all the TODO comments
3. Run the test: `python3 test_exercise_19.py`

### What you'll practice

- **Workflow planning**: Breaking down complex tasks
- **Tool coordination**: Selecting and chaining tools
- **Decision logic**: Conditional execution paths
- **Result processing**: Aggregating multiple tool outputs

### Key Concepts

- **Agentic workflows**: Autonomous task execution
- **Tool orchestration**: Coordinating multiple tools
- **Decision trees**: Conditional logic in workflows
- **State management**: Tracking workflow progress

### Expected Output

When all tests pass, you should see:
```
All tests passed! You're ready for MCP Project 19!
```

### Tips

- Plan workflows before implementing
- Handle tool failures gracefully
- Test with various scenarios and edge cases
- Consider performance and resource usage

Once you've completed this exercise, you'll know how to build agentic workflows that orchestrate multiple tools in MCP!
