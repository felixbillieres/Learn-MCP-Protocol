# Python Exercises for MCP Project 17

Before implementing LLM sampling in MCP, let's practice message building and response processing.

## Exercise 17: LLM Sampling & Message Handling

This exercise covers:
- Message structure creation for LLM requests
- Response parsing and processing
- Context management in conversations
- Error handling for API calls

### Instructions

1. Open `exercise_17.py`
2. Complete all the TODO comments
3. Run the test: `python3 test_exercise_17.py`

### What you'll practice

- **Message building**: Creating proper LLM request formats
- **Response handling**: Processing and validating LLM outputs
- **Context management**: Maintaining conversation state
- **Error processing**: Handling API failures gracefully

### Key Concepts

- **Sampling**: Requesting completions from language models
- **Message roles**: user, assistant, system distinctions
- **Content types**: Text and structured content handling
- **Async processing**: Non-blocking API interactions

### Expected Output

When all tests pass, you should see:
```
All tests passed! You're ready for MCP Project 17!
```

### Tips

- Always validate message structure before sending
- Handle both successful responses and errors
- Consider rate limiting and token usage
- Test with various input types and edge cases

Once you've completed this exercise, you'll know how to implement LLM sampling and message handling in MCP!
