# Project 18: Advanced sampling with preferences and parameters

## Objective

Learn to use model preferences and advanced sampling parameters.

## Concepts to learn

### Model preferences

Servers can suggest preferences for model selection:
- `hints`: Model suggestions (e.g., "claude-3-sonnet")
- `intelligencePriority`: Priority on capabilities (0-1)
- `speedPriority`: Priority on speed (0-1)
- `costPriority`: Priority on cost (0-1)

### Sampling parameters

- `temperature`: Creativity (0-2)
- `max_tokens`: Maximum number of tokens
- `stop_sequences`: Sequences that stop generation

### Multiple messages

You can send multiple messages to create a conversation with context.

## What you will create

In this project, you will create tools that use advanced sampling parameters.
