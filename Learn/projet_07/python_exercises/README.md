# Python Exercises for MCP Project 07

Before building your first complete MCP server, let's practice integrating all the concepts learned so far in a todo list application.

## Exercise 07: Complete MCP Server (First Capstone)

This exercise covers:
- Full integration of all MCP concepts learned
- Complete server architecture with tools and resources
- Data models for task management
- CRUD operations implementation

### Instructions

1. Open `exercise_07.py`
2. Complete all the TODO comments
3. Run the test: `python3 test_exercise_07.py`

### What you'll practice

- **Task model**: Complete Pydantic model with validation
- **TodoManager class**: Business logic for task operations
- **CRUD operations**: Create, read, update, delete tasks
- **Data persistence**: In-memory task storage

### Key Concepts

- **Complete models**: All field types and validation rules
- **Business logic**: Task management operations
- **Data structures**: Lists and model relationships
- **Error handling**: Proper validation and error responses

### Expected Output

When all tests pass, you should see:
```
All tests passed! You're ready for MCP Project 07!
```

### Tips

- Start with the Task model and validation
- Implement basic CRUD operations first
- Add error handling for edge cases
- Test with various task scenarios

Once you've completed this exercise, you'll know how to build complete MCP applications integrating all learned concepts!
