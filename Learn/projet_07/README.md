# Project 07: Final project - Complete mini MCP server

## Objective

Create a complete mini MCP server that combines all the concepts learned! This project will be simplified but comprehensive.

## What you will create

An MCP server to manage a todo list with:
- Pydantic models for tasks
- Tools for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Complete error handling
- Logging with Context
- Filters and statistics

## Recap of concepts

You will use:
- FastMCP to create the server
- Tools with `@mcp_server.tool()`
- Pydantic models to structure data
- Context for logging
- Error handling with validation
- Complex types (lists, optionals)

## Expected structure

Your final project should have:
```
projet_07/
├── solution.py        # All your code (to simplify)
├── README.md
├── INSTRUCTIONS.md
└── test.py
```
