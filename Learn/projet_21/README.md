# Project 21: Tokens and advanced validation

## Objective

Implement more advanced token validation with scopes, audiences, and expiration.

## Concepts to learn

### Scopes

Scopes define permissions (e.g., "read:data", "write:data"). A token can have multiple scopes.

### Audiences

The audience indicates which resource the token is intended for. This is crucial for security.

### Complete validation

- Token format
- Signature (if JWT)
- Expiration
- Audience
- Required scopes

## What you will create

In this project, you will create token validation with scopes and audiences.
