# Python Exercises for MCP Project 14

Before implementing MCP elicitation features, let's practice user interaction patterns and data collection workflows.

## Exercise 14: Elicitation & User Interaction

This exercise covers:
- User data collection patterns
- Interactive form structures
- Validation of user-provided information
- Elicitation workflow management

### Instructions

1. Open `exercise_14.py`
2. Complete all the TODO comments
3. Run the test: `python3 test_exercise_14.py`

### What you'll practice

- **ElicitationManager class**: Managing user interactions
- **Form structures**: Defining data collection requirements
- **Validation logic**: Checking user-provided data
- **Workflow handling**: Multi-step user interactions

### Key Concepts

- **Elicitation**: Requesting information from users
- **Interactive forms**: Structured data collection
- **User validation**: Ensuring data quality and completeness
- **Workflow states**: Managing multi-step interactions

### Expected Output

When all tests pass, you should see:
```
All tests passed! You're ready for MCP Project 14!
```

### Tips

- Define clear validation rules for each field
- Handle different data types appropriately
- Provide meaningful error messages for invalid data
- Test various user input scenarios

Once you've completed this exercise, you'll know how to implement MCP elicitation for user data collection!
